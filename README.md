# q-state-potts-model
General simulation of the q-state Potts model on a 2D square lattice of varying size. In this edition, the q = 4 state is chosen for plots of lattices of size 4, 6 and 8.

The Potts model is a generalization of the Ising model, used to represent the magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins across a lattice.
